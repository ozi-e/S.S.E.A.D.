Raspberry Pi, Arduino MEGA 2560 &amp; MultiWii Pro based drone with object evasion.

Arduino program to sequentially read 8 (easily alterable) HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensors and interpret them to a MultiWii Pro through a Raspberry Pi (for future camera addons etc.) to avoid obstacles within its vicinity.


Requirements:

  Raspberry Pi
  
  Arduino (in my case MEGA 2560, should work with others, need to alter code)
  
  MultiWii Pro
  
  4 ESC's
  
  4 brushless motors
  
  6 channel controller
  
  Blades
  
  Sturdy frame
  
  Battery (in my case 4S)
  
  8 HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensors
  
  Arduino IDE
  
  Male to Female cables (quite a lot)
  
  
Instructions:

  Assemble the drone
  
  Cut out an octagonal shape, or 3d print a holder for 8 ultrasonic sensors
  
  Assemble the holder with 8 sensors
  
  Connect all VCC inputs and GND with each other and branch it off to the Arduino VCC and GND
  
    NOT IN SERIES, but in parallel
