Raspberry Pi, Arduino MEGA 2560 &amp; MultiWii Pro based drone with object evasion.

Arduino program to sequentially read 8 (easily alterable) HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensors and interpret them to a MultiWii Pro through a Raspberry Pi (for future camera addons etc.) to avoid obstacles within its vicinity.

Requirements:
  Raspberry Pi
  Arduino (in my case MEGA 2560, should work with others, need to alter code)
  MultiWii Pro
  4 ESC's
  4 brushless motors
  6 channel controller
  Blades
  Sturdy frame
  Battery (in my case 4S)
  8 HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensors
  Arduino IDE
  Male to Female cables (quite a lot)
  
Instructions:
  Assemble the drone
  Cut out an octagonal shape, or 3d print a holder for 8 ultrasonic sensors
  Assemble the holder with 8 sensors
  Connect all VCC inputs and GND with each other and branch it off to the Arduino VCC and GND
    NOT IN SERIES, but in parallel

Changelog:
  Drone assembly, optimization -- done
  Order parts -- done, subject to change
